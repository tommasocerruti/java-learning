I live the "perfect" life.
I have more money, more love, more friends, and more family than absolutely anybody I’ve ever met.
I am one of the most famous men alive and I am doing GOOD things.
I have a purpose (something most men lack), a positive one, 
and I am shifting the entire planet toward GOOD in the battle against evil.
But every time life is TOO perfect God hits me with something that makes life hard again. 
A new war.
God puts me back in the frame of mind needed to be grateful for the things I didn’t appreciate enough.
When I left jail... I appreciated a pillow. 
A PILLOW made me smile for weeks.
Before jail, it took jets and Bugattis to make me smile like that.
In my life, every single hardship I’ve endured has made me a stronger and more capable version of myself.
Anybody who ever lost me lived to regret losing me.
Anybody who ever lied about me, or made an enemy of me, lived to regret doing exactly that.
I always win, in the end.
I thank God for all of the good but also for every single struggle. 
I need these battles. 
Allah is the best of planners and if he decides I must suffer then I accept this.
What kind of man isn’t fighting a war?
Thank you God for every single ounce of pain.
Thank you God for the sleepless nights and the withheld tears.
I want to show God that I am strong enough to endure anything he decides that I need.
I will fight until my last breath and never disappoint him.
I will get up every single day and perform at the best of my potential, rain or shine.
God wanted a warrior and he has one.
God willing, I am ready for anything.
